## Technical Details
The current user interface in Tauri apps leverages Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) or Webkit via EdgeHTML / Chakra on Windows. **Tauri** is based on the MIT licensed prior work known as [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) and [web-view]().

## Organizational Structure
Tauri apps is governed by the community and work is done in the context of public working groups. Each working group has a dedicated channel on the Discord server as well as a Team on GitHub. Other than that, each WG is free to use whatever type of organizational model it chooses.
 
 The current working groups are: 
- WG Governance & Guidance
- WG Tech
- WG Education
- WG Media
- WG Security

With the exception of the security working group, which is by invite only and convenes privately, all other working groups are public and open to any and all participants.
